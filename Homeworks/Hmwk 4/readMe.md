//README:
//I used the node.js Udemy course by Rob Percival to help my understand how to use socket.io in a chat application. Socket.io automatically updates messages rather than running a timer that runs queries. 
//I also used sequelize to help me run sql queries. Sequelize is an npm module that simplifies the syntax of sql. It also inherently protects against sql injections. I create objects for things like messages and chatRooms. Therefore, whenever I create an object/run a query, then it is put through validators on each object, therefore blocking any sql injections.
//I use socket io to create realtime chat between the users, but I also save messages and users to a database to make sure they persist in a chatroom.
